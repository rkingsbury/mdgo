OPC3 water model
# Original model from Izadi and Onufriev, Accuracy limit of rigid 3-point water models
# J. Chemical Physics 145, 074501, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4960175, Table II.
# real units (kcal/mol, Angstrom) 
# Command 'fix shake' is needed.
# LJ and couloumb cutoffs of 9 and 7 angstroms are adopted from the TIP3B-FB paper
# Bond and angle coefficients of 1000 are added to keep the water molecule together
# during e.g. energy minimization in LAMMPS when `fix shake` is not active.
