# real units (kcal/mol, Angstrom) 
# Command 'fix shake' is needed.
# LJ and couloumb cutoffs of 9 and 7 angstroms were used in the original work
# Bond and angle coefficients of 1000 are added to keep the water molecule together
# during e.g. energy minimization in LAMMPS when `fix shake` is not active.
